JPixel Library
==============

JPixel is a simple library intended to work with graphic interfaces in Java.

Currently JPixel contains:
* 2D Vectors
* Simplified input handling for simple games
* Simple color math for Java games that are based on by-pixel rendering

### To do (maybe in future):
* More math helpers
* Simple 2D by-pixel renderer
* Extended input handling
